# 🎨 Sammi Carr — Portfolio Site

**Welcome to the digital home of Sammi Carr**, a multidisciplinary visual artist based on Dharawal land, NSW. This portfolio isn't just another gallery grid — it's a curated experience, a scroll-through museum, and a love letter to art in motion.

## 🌐 Live Website

## 💌 About the Project

This site was designed and developed by [Annisa Nye](https://annisanye.com), who believes that artists deserve websites as thoughtful and beautiful as their work.
The portfolio mimics the feel of walking through a physical gallery, turning clicks into strolls.

> *“A portfolio site should be more than a résumé. It should feel like stepping into the artist’s world — this one does.”*
