# Sammi Carr Portfolio â€“ Horizontally-Scrolling Art Gallery Website

This project is a bold, playful, and immersive portfolio for **Sammi Carr**, a multidisciplinary visual artist based on Dharawal land (NSW). The website mimics the experience of walking through a physical art gallery â€” using horizontal transitions and thoughtful layout spacing to showcase Sammiâ€™s work with elegance and impact.

It is designed for professional submissions (grants/residencies) while offering a rich, curated alternative to Instagram.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Philosophy

Inspired by [fbi.radio](https://fbi.radio), the website focuses on:

- A **white background** and clean typography
- **Center-aligned, floating top menu** that shows the current section
- **Horizontal scroll transitions** between each full-screen section (simulated using Framer Motion)
- Individual artworks displayed with generous spacing, like walking through a gallery
- Title cards, subtle animations, and gallery labels under artworks

---

## ðŸ§­ Navigation Behavior

- Navigation bar sits centered at the top
- Displays: Home, About, CV, Gallery, Residencies, Contact
- When the user is on the **Gallery** page, a **secondary sub-menu** appears:
  - Paintings, Illustrations, Collages, Digital, Animations

---

## ðŸ–¼ Gallery Behavior

- Sections scroll **left to right**
- Each artwork is framed, centered, and spaced apart like a museum wall
- **Animations** are vertical and may be embedded as GIFs or videos
- Thunderfox video is embedded within the Animations section
