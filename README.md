# Sammi Carr Portfolio – One-Page Website

This project is a bold, playful, and modern one-page portfolio for **Sammi Carr**, serving as a professional and artistic showcase for grant and residency applications.

The site is designed to emphasize high-impact visual storytelling, scrollable galleries, and a uniquely personal brand identity, inspired by [fbi.radio](https://www.fbi.radio/). It will eventually replace Instagram as a more curated and professional submission tool.

- Provide a professional alternative to Instagram for submissions and outreach
